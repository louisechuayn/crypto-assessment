# Crypto Data Analysis Project

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that analyze different aspects of the cryptocurrency market using public APIs.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two separate analyses:

### Task One: Wallet Transactions

This notebook analyses the transaction history of a specific Ethereum whale wallet. It uses the Etherscan API (token required) to fetch up to 10,000 transactions for the wallet. The data is then processed and visualized as a bi-directional weighted graph of the 20 most recent transactions, with wallets as nodes and transactions as arrows. The thickness of the arrows is weighted by the transaction value.

### Task Two: Dogecoin Market Analysis

This notebook analyses Dogecoin's market data, including price and volume. It fetches data from the CoinGecko API for a specific date range. The data is cleaned and visualized using a time series plot that displays both price and volume, with annotations for key events.


## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/louisechuayn/crypto-assessment.git
cd dogecoin-forensics

### 2. Set up environment
Using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or using conda:
conda create -n doge-analysis python=3.12
conda activate doge-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run task_one.ipynb
Run task_two.ipynb

## Results

### Macro-Level Analysis
Volume vs. Output Total (USD): Highlighted spikes around 11 Nov 4pm and 12 Nov 3â€“5pm.
CDD Analysis: Highest CDD spike observed on 13 Nov 4am, following unusual outputs.

### Micro-Level Analysis
Transaction-level data in suspicious windows revealed bursts of unusually high-value transfers.
Some spikes corresponded to old wallets moving DOGE (high CDD), consistent with manipulation risk.
